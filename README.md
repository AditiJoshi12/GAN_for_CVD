# GAN_for_CVD
Files and Datasets made during Infosys Springboard Internship : GAN for CVD

This repository contains the files which include code written for Infosys Springboard Internship : GAN(General Adversarial Network) for CVD(Color Vision Deficiency).
These include the Google Colaboratory Notebooks as well as the datasets created.  
There are essentially 3 datasets - Original Images Dataset, Simulated Dataset (how people with CVD see the pictures in the dataset),
Recolored Dataset (or the color compensated dataset, which is the dataset obtained after applying the color compensation algorithm).
